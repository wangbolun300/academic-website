#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am working with Prof. Leif Kobbelt as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of RWTH Aachen, Germany. Before that, I worked with Prof. Helmut Pottmann as a Postdoc at the Visual Computing Center (VCC) of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). I obtained my Ph.D. in Fundamental Mathematics from Beihang University in 2022 under the supervision of Prof. Zhiming Zheng and Prof. Xin Jiang. During 2019-2020, I worked as a visiting student under the supervision of Prof. Daniele Panozzo at New York University. I received my B.S. degree from Beihang University in 2016. My research interests are in computer graphics, geometric modeling, geometry processing, and discrete differential geometry.
