summary: 'We introduce a large scale benchmark for CCD: We use the benchmark to evaluate existing algorithms, and to validate a novel CCD algorithm called tight-inclusion, which is fast and conservative.'
abstract: "Continuous collision detection is a critical part in physical simulations. if a CCD algorithm reports too many collisions that don't exist, or missing collisions, the simulation may fail or be inaccurate.

We introduce a large scale benchmark for CCD: We use the benchmark to evaluate existing algorithms, and to validate a novel CCD algorithm called tight-inclusion, which is fast and conservative.

For more details, please read our paper https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/34.... We have release our code, please check the following link https://github.com/Continuous-Collisi... where you can find the implementations of our algorithm and all the comparison methods, and the large scale benchmark."

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Hugo Blox Builder's [_Slides_](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/content-types/) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/markdown/).

Further event details, including [page elements](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/markdown/) such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page. -->
