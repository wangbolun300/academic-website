abstract: For three-axis sculptured surface machining, a tool path generation method based on the feed directions of maximum machining strip width is proposed. We use a B-Spline stream function to reconstruct the vector field of feed directions, and give the initial tool path by one of the iso-lines of the stream function. The integrated tool paths are generated using traditional iso-scallop method based on the previous obtained initial path. Numerical results show that the tool paths match the optimal vector field in the least square sense. Further a total shorter tool path length can be obtained.
